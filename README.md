# Commercial Property Audit Analysis

## Description
This project addresses audit-focused questions on rental properties across several U.S. cities. The dataset covers three property types—office spaces, warehouses, and retail spaces—and includes rent prices, maintenance costs, and property age. The objective is to assess the data’s scope, spot outliers, and get a snapshot of each city’s rental landscape.

## Key Insights
The analysis reveals patterns that can help real estate investors or property managers identify high-cost property types and cities with significant rent deviations.

## Technologies Used
- Excel / Google Sheets for data analysis and pivot tables.
